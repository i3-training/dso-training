# Push and Pull docker image from private registry

## Configure Nexus repo

### Adding new user

For security concern we won't allow anonymous access to our repo because of this we need to create user to give user in our organization access to the registry, gif below showing how to create a user in nexus.

![create user](/Chapter-3-Nexus/img/nexus-createuser.gif)

First you need to login in web console then open server administration and configuration, on the side bar click user then select Create local user, fill the form then click Create local user.

### Setting up local machine

To connect with the registry you can use this command.

```bash
docker login myregistrydomain.com:port
```

You will be prompted for your username and password

> **Note**
>
> since we don't configure our registry with SSL docker login wont work, we need to configure our registry as insecure-registries to bypass TLS verification, the step will be explain below.

Edit the `daemon.json` file, whose default location is `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on Linux or `C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json` on Windows Server. If you use Docker Desktop for Mac or Docker Desktop for Windows, click the Docker icon, choose Preferences (Mac) or Settings (Windows), and choose Docker Engine. Then add following entry

```config
{
  "insecure-registries" : ["myregistrydomain.com:port"]
}
```

save the `daemon.json` file and restart docker, to change take efect, after docker is restarted you can use login command above to login to your registry.

### Pushing an image to the registry

Build your image  with tag that indicate your registry as example `myregistrydomain.com:port/image-name:0.01`
or alternatively you can tag existing image to be push to your registry.

```bash
# Build new image from dockerfile/containerfile
docker build -f /project-dir/dockerfile -t myregistrydomain.com:port/image-name:0.01 .

# Tag existing image to remote registry
docker tag existing-image:0.01 myregistrydomain.com:port/image-name:0.01
```

after image is tag with remote registry domain or ip address we can push the image to the registry.

```bash
docker push myregistrydomain.com:port/image-name:0.01
```

it will showing output as shown below.

```bash
The push refers to repository [10.8.60.126:5000/php-base72]
47bc23effc15: Pushed 
ee36a60a1682: Pushed 
0f688ab01ffa: Pushed 
54e3206bdb11: Pushed 
5a956476e24e: Pushed 
6d88bb489305: Pushed 
a7bfd861243f: Pushed 
1da30dcf5ecb: Pushed 
cca79f034738: Pushed 
c08bb97307de: Pushed 
2b5724e99e93: Pushed 
72289fa6c929: Pushed 
77cae8ab23bf: Pushed 
1.01: digest: sha256:30f00da21ab946f6cb44dfe3f4bed29dd1cb96be7f514fcde4810602418e47ae size: 3041
```

Now we can check the image on nexus via web console, on home select search and select docker image being push will show here.

### pulling an image from the registry

you can see your image from web console and refer there when trying to pulling the image as shown below

![image registry](/Chapter-3-Nexus/img/image-registry.png)

use standard docker pull command to pull the image

```bash
docker pull myregistrydomain.com:port/image-name:0.01
```
