# Nexus Repository OSS Administration

## Manage Roles

In the Nexus Repository, a role is a set of permissions that determine what actions a user can perform within the repository. Roles are used to control access to the repository and the functions that users can perform within the repository. For example, a user with the Deployment role might be able to upload components to the repository, while a user with the Developer role might only be able to view and download components.

The Nexus Repository includes a set of predefined roles, but custom roles can also be created to meet the specific needs of an organization. The roles and permissions in Nexus Repository can be managed through the Nexus Repository web interface, allowing administrators to control access to the repository and the functions that users can perform.

Assigning roles to users helps to ensure that only authorized users have access to the repository and can perform specific actions within the repository, providing security and control over the components and dependencies stored in the repository.

### Create New Role

To create new role you need to login as administrative privileged account, then go to administration (settings icon), on security go to Roles then select create role, on Role Type select `Nexus Role` then fill all required form. administrator can select Privileges and Roles that already exist to customize new role being created.

6. Once you have made the desired changes, click on the "Save" button to save the changes to the role.

Note that changes to roles can affect multiple users, so be careful when editing roles to ensure that the changes you make are appropriate for the needs of your organization.

It's also worth mentioning that changes to roles can take some time to take effect, as they may need to be propagated to all users who have been assigned the role.
